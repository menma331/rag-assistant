The objective of this session is to identify the four types of retailers or shops to describe the key features of successful retailers and to explain the importance of developing a vision for improvement on your business. So in terms of the types of retailers, there are four types of retailers. The first is a basic retailer. A basic retail operation maintains and supports itself at a minimum level required just to stay in business no more. The second is called the nearly basic retailer.

Third type of retailers called a sustainable retailer, these retailers have a reliable reputation with suppliers and and can connect them to connect with them to procure needed inputs on seasonal credit terms. The fourth type of retailer is the mainstay retailer. These retailers are on good credit terms with multiple suppliers. They have a reliable supply of inventory that meets market demand. And in addition to inputs. They also sell other supplies and services. Regardless of what category your operation falls into, there is always room to improve. Next, let's talk about the key features of successful retailers. So successful retailers have a solid customer base that means customers who come back and do business with you time after time, they also offer a good mix of products, products that their me, their customers want to buy and need.

Um That is easy to find, easy for customers to find. Um They have a vision for their business in terms of uh what success looks like. They do financial record keeping and accounting. Um They have frequent inventory turnover. They have separate bank accounts for the business, so they separate their business from their personal and other personal accounts. Um and then they add additional services that are important to customers such as off taking maybe transportation of the input sold. So let's discuss one of these characteristics, which is having a vision for your business. Um It's important that if your business just stays the same, it is essentially going backwards, your competitors will improve and you will lose business to them.

To describe the qualities and characteristics of a good leader. We will detail how leaders interact with their customers and we will talk with you about developing one leadership school skill. Leadership is one of the most important things. Management does effective leadership can maximize efficiency and help a business achieve its goals. So let's discuss what does entrepreneurship refer to entrepreneurship is a process of identifying opportunities in the marketplace, identifying the strategies to pursue those opportunities, arranging the resources required to achieve those opportunities and investing in the resources to enable long term gains. An entrepreneur is a person who starts a business and is willing to risk loss to make it successful. Entrepreneurs recognize opportunities and generate innovative and creative ideas. Entrepreneurship refers to the process of identifying opportunities in the marketplace, identifying strategies to pursue those opportunities and arranging the resources required to pursue these opportunities and investing those resources to enable long term gains. It involves starting or expanding a business and adding a new product or service to an existing business investing in and risking capital, selling a product or a service and working to get a return on that investment. Now, let's talk a little bit about um the qualities of entrepreneurs. What are the key qualities that entrepreneurs demonstrate? Well, they actively seek opportunities uh for growing the business. They demand efficiency and quality in their business. They want to sell the best quality products at the lowest cost. They are information seeking. They want to understand how to be successful. They wanna know what their competitors are doing. They wanna know what their customers need. They are planners and they are goal oriented. They set goals for the year and then they track to see whether they're on progress to meet those goals. They are confident, they are sure that of their success. They are good listeners, they need to understand what customers need. Um and what's their suppliers need. Uh They show leadership, they make decisions when decisions are needed. They sometimes they make hard decisions and they encourage people around them to also be successful. They are perseverance. So when things get hard, they continue to push forward, they are risk taking, they're willing to invest in capital and some and their time and success. And they are persuasive, persuasive, they, they can convince their customers and and help their customers understand why doing business with them is a good place to do business and you will be looking after their needs and they're strategic, you decide what are the right investments and how should you uh make those in your business? So let's talk a little bit about leadership. What is an entrepreneur as a business manager? You need to be a strong leader. So what are four things that good leaders do? Well, first, they create an inspiring vision of the future. They motivate people to engage in that vision, they manage the realization of that vision and they coach and build a team so that it can achieve the vision. So what does it mean to create an aspiring vision? A vision is a realistic depiction of where you want to be in the future? What will your business look like in one year? What will it look like in five years? If you define that, then you can start to define the steps for achieving it. They motivate and inspire people to engage with that vision. You need to use communication skills to encourage people to want to achieve that vision with you. We will talk more about ways to motivate people later in this module, they manage the realization of the vision. This is all the day to day activities required to achieve that vision, vision. Um Most of this training programs deals with this. How do you manage your shop? How do you communicate with customers? Have you listened and trained someone who can operate your shop in your absence? These all relate to delivering on that vision and leaders also coach and build a committed customer base that you can achieve that vision. It goes beyond motivating people to want to achieve the vision. This is what this is about helping them develop the skills to achieve it. So what what are the characteristics that make a good leader are they're approachable? So your customers or the people who work in your shop field that they can come to you and ask you questions, you're enthusiastic, you're enthusiastic about the business. You're enthusiastic about their success. You have strong communication skills. That means you listen as well as explain clearly. You're able to delegate, you don't hold everything to yourself. You delegate maybe to family members to people who uh work with you. Um And you're dedicated, you're dedicated to your customers, to their success and to the success of your business. You're confident that you can uh achieve the success and help your customers to be more successful. And you're honest, you, you provide a good product at a good price and you do not take advantage of people for short term advantage. So one of the things of a leader we talked about is you need to be able to motivate people. So what are the three ways that help motivate people? First? You listen attentively, you make eye contact, you ask for clarification. If you don't understand, you use body language to communicate that you are listening and you do not interrupt when people are, are telling you what they need. Um You give good feedback. Well, how do you give good feedback? You're specific, you give positive and negative feedback in the moment. Don't let these issues linger, don't uh build up resentments. Um You give feedback, face to face, don't critic, criticize or provide negative feedback publicly and be willing to listen to feedback from your shop assistants and from your customers. Um And the third thing you do to motivate people is you recognize good work, recognize the person by name, specify exactly what you're recognizing that person for, point out their good work and specifically what they did, right? Or well, this, this includes people who work for you and shop, but it also includes your customers. Everyone likes a compliment. Remember, people are motivated to do good work when they notice, noticed and appreciated. OK, so let's review what we've just talked about in this session. You've",

                "text": "What are bookkeeping procedures:\n\nWhat is a procedure? A procedure is a series of steps conducted in a defined order and manner that is used to achieve a specific outcome. To be effective. Procedures must be written down and recorded in a procedure manual. So that one responsible for carrying out the steps can find them and follow them without difficulty. When you store receipts and maintain. Ledgers having defined procedures will help you achieve the outcome of a well organized bookkeeping and filing system. Defining and documenting procedures for bookkeeping and record keeping is an important part of your action plan. Let's walk through an example of a bookkeeping procedure. Let's say you just filled your truck with fuel and received a paper receipt for the purchase. The first thing you should do is tape or glue the paper receipt to a piece of a four paper. Next stamp the paper with today's date, the date you receive the receipt and if necessary, write a note on the paper explaining what the purchase was for, then file the receipt in the appropriate expense binder in the order of the date received. In this example, the receipt would be filed in the vehicle receipts binder note that the paper receipts may fade over time.\n\nWhat is bookkeeping and why is it important:\n\nBookkeeping is the process of tracking financial transactions and recording those transactions in ledgers or books. Bookkeeping allows you to see where your business is spending money, where it is generating money and whether there is enough money to run the business. Here are three reasons. Bookkeeping is important for your business. One bookkeeping helps you oversee and manage your business effectively. Strong bookkeeping practices can help you identify areas for improvement, catch errors and identify fraud or theft. Two, bookkeeping helps you with planning. You cannot reliably make purchases or invest in your business. If you do not know how much money you have. Bookkeeping allows you to budget for future expenses. Three bookkeeping prepares you to apply for a loan. A lender will want to see financial statements before approving a business loan application. Those financial statements come from bookkeeping. Proper bookkeeping involves the preparation of source documents for all financial transactions. Examples of source documents include receipts and invoices. You must keep and organize source documents to ensure transactional information is recorded in the correct ledgers. This requires you to follow bookkeeping procedures. Continue this course to learn more about bookkeeping procedures.\n\nWhat is the difference between bookkeeping and accounting:\n\nSo far, we have focused on aspects of bookkeeping which is related to accounting but how are bookkeeping and accounting different. A bookkeeper performs tasks in accordance with the businesses established procedures such as collecting and filing records of business transactions, recording transactions in a ledger and tracking your business's cash balance. In comparison, an accountant uses the numbers registered in your business ledgers to carry out a separate set of tasks that are defined in the law of your country or region. These include consolidating bookkeeping entries into numbered accounts in a book called the General Ledger. This is a detailed ledger whose format is dictated by the laws of your country or region. The production of financial statements from the General Ledger, including the income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement and the preparation of tax filings. Note that the income statement is used to calculate the business's surplus at the end of the year.",

                "text": "What are cash flows and how do they relate to cash balance:\n\nAnything that brings cash into the business is a cash inflow. Anything that takes cash out of the business is a cash outflow. Only actual cash is considered business transactions not involving cash do not represent a cash flow. For example, providing inputs to a farmer is not a cash transaction. However, a payment to a farmer for delivery of product is considered a cash outflow. Even when the value of the inputs is deducted from the payment. After you finish classifying your cash flows as in or out, you will be able to determine your cash balance in a cash ledger for a given period of time. In our example, we'll be using the day's operations as the time period. Your cash balance is determined by taking the starting balance of the period. In this example, it's 10 million plus cash in for the day's operations of 4 million minus cash out for the day's operations of 3 million to get the ending cash balance of 11 million. The ending balance for this period becomes the starting balance for the next period. Each time your business performs a financial transaction, you should file the supporting documents and update the appropriate transactional ledger and cash ledger to determine the cash balance.\n\nWhat is a cash ledger and how do you use it:\n\nA cash ledger is used to track movements of cash in and out of your business so that you know your cash balance. In the example on the screen, the first line of the ledger shows the starting balance for the month. The sale to the customer is a cash in transaction and the amount is added to the balance on the previous line to obtain the current balance. The payment to farmer 028 and the purchase of petrol are cash out transactions. Each amount is subtracted from the balance on the previous line to obtain the current balance. This slide shows a single ledger for the purpose of demonstrating how a cash ledger works for training purposes. We will not focus on whether these transactions are by bank or cash on hand. Let's discuss the columns in the cash ledger in more detail column, one shows the date the transaction occurred. This is not the date that you updated the cash ledger in your cash ledger. You may add a column to indicate the date that the entry was made into the cash ledger. Column two shows the source ledger for the transaction. Although some businesses only maintain a single cash ledger as your operations expand. It may become more practical to keep separate expense and sales ledgers as well. These ledgers are the source of transactional data and feed the cash ledger so you can track your business's cash balance. When you use multiple ledgers, you will enter details of each monetary transaction into two ledgers. Although at first, this may seem like you are recording each transaction twice the cash ledger entries and the records of cash transactions have very different purposes. This example shows that the sources of the cash transactions are the sales farmer and expense. Ledgers. Column three shows a description of the transaction. This information is taken from the source ledger. It will likely include less detail than what has been entered into the source ledger. Columns four and five indicate the value of the transaction. If cash flowed into the business as a result of this transaction, the total value of the transaction is entered in column four. If cash flowed out of the business as a result of this transaction, the total value of the transaction is entered in column five, column six shows the cash balance. After each transaction is recorded, the starting balance on the first row is the ending balance from the previous month. This amount should have been confirmed or reconciled against your bank statement or physical count of petty cash. Any difference should have been resolved before the end of the previous month. The value of cash in transactions are added to the balance from the previous row. The value of a cash out transaction is subtracted from the previous balance. The balance in your cash ledger must match your actual cash on hand and or in your bank account assuming that the last transaction for the month of August 2020 was the purchase of petrol on August 20. What would the final cash balance be for the month? This amount is calculated by taking 179,500,000 minus 30,000 for a final cash balance of 179,470,000. In this example, the payment to farmer 028 occurred after the sales transaction. If the payment had occurred before the sales transaction, the business would have experienced an overdraft, an overdraft results in a negative cash balance. If this happens, contact your bank to alert them of the overdraft and inform them that you are expecting a payment by updating your cash ledger, you will know your cash balance on a daily basis. You must ensure that the number you have in your books matches your bank balance and physical cash on hand. If you have access to your bank account online, check it daily. If you do not have access to your bank account online, check regularly with your bank to confirm your balance. Also count physical cash each day to confirm the balance at the end of each day, your cash ledger balance must match the sum of your physical cash plus your cash in banks. This is one of the most important tasks in the financial management of a business. This if you do not have a match, you need to investigate and resolve the discrepancy. A mismatch is often the result of human error in recording transactions. But it could also indicate a more serious problem such as theft. One way to help prevent problems with cash is to implement cash controls in your business.\n\nWhy do you need cash controls:\n\nControls for cash are particularly important since physical cash can disappear without a trace if it is not monitored. Examples of cash controls include cash is locked in a safe, if cash will not be spent, it is deposited in the bank. If cash is spent, it is recorded in the organization's financial books and supporting documents is logged. Checks are signed by at least two authorized officials. No blank checks are signed. Cash books are updated at least once a week if not more often. And cash count reconciliation and bank reconciliations are done each month to compare ledgers with physical cash and ledgers. In addition to cash controls, your business must establish an internal control system which can be used by management to ensure the accuracy, integrity and transparency of financial information. These controls require compliance with the rules and procedures of the business and ensure the clear and honest presentation of information with no attempt made to conceal data. They must be documented, incorporated into policy manuals and create an audit trail that allows every financial transaction to be traced back to its documented source. Internal controls can be preventative or detective preventative controls are policies and procedures that do not allow certain things to happen. They are the first line of defense in a financial accounting system. Preventative controls include two signatures for payment approvals, cash control procedures, training on policies and procedures approval process for purchases locked safe for cash, locked warehouse and locked cabinets for files and records. Detective controls back up preventative controls. If the first line of defense fails, missed items may be caught by the detective controls. Detective controls include audits of ledgers, checking physical assets against ledgers, comparing transactions to source documents, comparing your cash ledger to your bank statement, monitoring expenses versus budget and taking physical inventory. Which internal controls have you implemented in your business?\n\nWhy is it important to track cash flow:\n\nCash flow management is a critical part of bookkeeping. Cash flow management involves tracking the money or cash coming into your business and the cash leaving your business. Cash flow management also involves anticipating how much cash you will need to run your business. You classify cash flows as either cash inflows or cash outflows. Anything that brings cash into your business is a cash inflow. For example, a cash sale to a customer. Another example of a cash inflow is the receipt of loan funds. Anything that takes cash out of your business is a cash outflow. For example, cash payments to farmers. Other examples of cash outflows are bill payments and employee wages. Not all transactions are cash flows. For example, when you provide inputs to farmers on credit, no cash is given or received. These are non cash transactions. Cash flow management is key to your business's success. Tracking cash flow allows you to determine how much money you have to run your business. If more money is leaving your business than coming in, you may not be able to pay upcoming expenses. A business can be profitable while not having enough cash, you can have lots of customers. But if they do not pay on time, you may not have enough cash on hand to run your business. Understanding. Cash flow is a first step to having a better view of your business's financial health.

These include petrol supplies such as seeds and fertilizers, salaries, office supplies, rent and insurance expenses are items that are consumed relatively quickly and do not last long. For example, once your pen runs out of ink, it can no longer be used once your petrol tank is empty, it has been consumed. Let's look at an example. One of your employees needs petrol for their truck. We assume the business provided the driver with cash, the driver filled up the truck with petrol and then returned with a receipt in the expense ledger record the purchase of petrol by entering the date the transaction occurred in column one. Next enter a description of the expense in column two, enter the quantity purchased. In this case, it was the number of liters of petrol in column three and the price per unit or liter of petrol in column four in the last column, enter the total cost. In this example, take the quantity of 50 times the unit price of 600 for a total of 30,000. Some items may not require units or a unit price. For example, salaries paid to employees may just have a total.",

                "text": "Let's talk about the supplier ledger. So in this session, we will classify supplier operational transactions as receivables, payable or cash. We will identify the records needed to track supplier transactions. We'll practice recording receivable, payable and crash cash transactions in a supplier ledger. And we will look at how you update the cash ledger with supplier cash transactions. So what are supplier payables and receivables? Supplier, payables and receivables are non cash transactions that have a monetary value for transactions with suppliers. A payable occurs when a supplier engages in a transaction with the business which results in the business owing money to the supplier. An example of a payable occurs when a supplier drops off product at the business warehouse won't be paid until a future date. The product has a monetary value that the business owes to the supplier. A receivable occurs when a supplier engages in a transaction with a business which results in the supplier owing money to the business. An example of a receivable is when the business returns items to the supplier that were damaged or defective when delivered, the items have a monetary value that the supplier must pay back or that the supplier owes to the business. A business can have a receivable and payable items on the book with a supplier. At the same time when a supplier is paid, the receivables aren't deducted from the payables. Remember that until the pay business pays a supplier or a supplier pays a business, no cash has exchanged hands. In these cases, a payable or receivable will not generate an entry into the cash letter ledger but other forms of documentation will be produced and used including receipts. What is a receipt for a payable? It includes the sa same type of information that is included on a receipt for receivable. In the example, on the slide, a supplier has delivered 30 kg of product to the business and will be paid for this delivery at a later date. The receipt indicates the supplier number. The transaction date, a description of the item, the quantity usually in kilograms, the rate and unit price for each kilogram a total for each item and a grand total. The supplier and an authorized employee of the business should sign this receipt and the supplier should hold on to its hold on to it as proof of the delivery. Ideally, your receipts will have carbon copies. The business bookkeeper will file the co copy of the receipt with the supplier ledger when he or she updates the books. If you do not have carbon copies, you may wish to set a policy in which the supplier and authorized employee initial the transaction in the supplier ledger which we will see on the following slides, a receipt for receivable. Whenever your business has any type of financial transaction with the supplier, there should be a receipt and the transaction must be recorded in the ledger first. We will look at a suggested receipt for receivable. In the example, on the slide, the retailer has provided inputs to a supplier. The inputs have a monetary value. So why is it not a cash transaction answer. Inputs are not cash. Once the business provides the inputs to the supplier, the supplier owes the business for the value of the inputs. Therefore, the business has a has a receivable with the supplier. When the retailer hands over the inputs to the supplier, the supplier should receive a physical receipt from the business that includes supplier number, date of the transaction, a description of each item, the quantity and rate unit price for each item, a total for each item and a grand total. You may wish to include signature lines on the receipt. If you use receipts with carbon copies, the business should file a copy in the folder with the supplier ledger which will then which we will review momentarily. If you do not use receipts with carbon copies, you should require that the supplier sign or initial line in the supplier ledger where this receivable will be recorded. Supplier, cash transactions, cash transaction with the supplier occurs when cash is exchanged between the business and the supplier. For the most part, these cash transactions will be payouts from the supplier's ledger balance after the supplier has delivered product to the business. So far in this course, we have not focused on whether cash transactions are managed with physical cash, electronic bank transactions check or another method of payment for training. We will present scenarios where all cash transactions are using physical cash. However, any transaction where a payment is made to a supplier with money, regardless whether the money is in the form of physical cash, a bank transfer or a check will be considered cash transaction. So, receipt, how do you record receipt for a payment to a supplier? When a supplier receives a payment from the business, he or she must sign a receipt to confirm that they have received the cash. You may use the same repeat receipt format that is used for receivables and payables. However, only a description and an amount are needed. The supplier and the employee authorized to make payments should sign this receipt. Ideally, your receipts will have a carbon copy so that the supplier receives one copy and the bookkeeper receives another copy to file in the supplier's folder. If you do not have carbon copies, you should require the supplier to sign our initial line in the supplier Ledger where this payment will be recorded. What is the supplier Ledger receivables, payables and cash payments to suppliers were recorded in the supplier's ledger which includes the following columns, the date of the transaction as well as a starting balance line which will include we included in an example on the screen, a description, a de sort description of the individual transaction, the quantity and the unit price used when the appropriate for when appropriate for transactions that involve goods that can be measured in units receivable. The value of a receivable payable, the value of a payable payment, the value of cash payment and the balance, the running total supplier balance receivables are added to the balance payables are subtracted signature used used by the supplier or the authorized business employee to sign for transactions. In this example, the supplier ended the previous month with a balance of 10,000 in his its favor. This is expresses a negative number in the balance column on the ledger. Why is this a negative number? Well, since the balance of 10,000 was in the supplier's favor, it is owed or payable to the supplier as a result is reflected as a negative number for the business. Ok, let's look at a supplier receivable transaction when recording a supplier receivable transaction. Enter the date of the transaction description, enter the value of the receivable and the receivable colum column add the value of the receivable to the previous entry in the balance column. And this example, the 25,000 receivable is added to the negative 10,000 starting balance the new balance is 15,000. The supplier will sign or initial the supply signature column recall that the supplier was given a receipt for these inputs. But this signature is the business is proof that the supplier received them supplier payable transaction when recording a supplier payable transaction, enter the date and the transaction description enter the value of the payable and the payable column enter the quantity delivered and unit price subtract the value of the payable from the previous entry in the balance column. In this example of 300,000 payable is subtracted from the 15,000 balance. The new balance is 285,000. Note to instructor. Uh although the retailer and supplier kept receipts for the delivery, you may wish to have the business employee and supplier initial or sign the line in the signature column. So how do we record a cash transaction when recording a payment to a supplier. Enter the date and transaction description, enter the amount of the payment column in the payment of the payment column, add the amount of the payment to the previous entry in the balance column. And this example 285,000 payment is added to the negative 285,000 balance. The new balance is zero note to instructor perform the calculations on a flip chart. Although the business and supplier kept receipts for the payment, you may wish to have the supplier initial or sign on the signature column, cash ledger updates. Once you have entered the payment transaction in the supplier ledger, you must make a corresponding entry in the cash ledger and update the balance.",

Financial statement constitute the fifth step of your accounting cycle. Financial statements are made up of three important statements, the income statements, the balance sheet and the cash flow statements. Why are they important for your business? First of all, financial statement will highlight the profitability of your business to highlight the financial performance of your business as well as the cash position of your business. Secondly, an analysis of financial statements will give you information required to take good financial management decisions and the decisions that you need to make in order to know how to grow your business profitably and sustainably. Tell me if you request a loan or if you want to enter into business relation with some partners, nearly always, they will request the three plus financial statements of your business. These are necessary for them to analyze and establish a pattern or the the trend of the profitability of your business and the ability of your business to generate cash flow projected into the future. This information will provide them with what we call credit worthiness that is is your business able to receive the loan, manage it profitably and generate eno enough cash to repay the loan. We are going to subsequently examine more about how to use financial statements to take good business management decisions. Thank you.\n\nWhat process does an accountant use to prepare financial statements:\n\nThe accounting cycle is a five step process of recording and managing accounting activities in a business. It starts with the collection of source documents and ends with the production of financial statements. Take a few moments to review the accounting cycle. An accountant will use ledgers prepared by your business to prepare the general ledger, the trial balance and the financial statements. Next, we'll look at the general ledger. Once you begin providing an accountant with your ledgers, he or she will be able to use the information from your ledgers to prepare a general ledger. Your business's general ledger is used to categorize and summarize all transactions into accounts that have been defined by laws and statutes in your country or region. A qualified accountant will be aware of the structure and accounts required for a general ledger in your country or region. Your ledgers should be up to date and well organized to ease the task of creating a general ledger. You may want to ask a qualified accountant to review your ledgers at the beginning of the fiscal period and to provide recommendations on how to improve your ledger record keeping at the end of a fiscal period. This can be a month quarter or year. An accountant using a general ledger will prepare a trial balance report. A trial balance is a list of all the general ledger accounts, both revenue and capital. The trial balance ensures that account balances were accurately extracted from the ledgers when they were entered into the general ledger. This process allows the accountant to identify and resolve any items that do not match before creating the financial statements. If there are any inconsistencies, an accountant will look to the original ledgers and possibly source documents to resolve any problems. In the final phase. The accountant will prepare the business's income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement. These financial statements will show the profitability, financial health and cash position of the business. Once financial statements are prepared for the year, businesses often hire a qualified accountant to conduct a financial statement audit. Always remember that the accounting cycle starts with an organized system of filing supporting documents and recording the transactions in daily operating ledgers.",

Inventory is the core of your business. You must order store and sell products. Customers want to buy, carry too much inventory and you risk spoilage theft and unsold products carry too little inventory and you risk upsetting customers by not having what they want. Inventory management helps you balance these competing demands. It helps you determine what to buy, how much to buy, how to store it and when to remove it from inventory. There are three main benefits for retailers that practice good inventory management. One inventory management helps you increase profits. You can focus on products that are in high demand, which leads to higher revenues. You'll spend less on stock that doesn't sell and reduce storage costs. That means more savings for you. Two, inventory management leads to happier customers. You can establish minimum inventory levels and make smarter decisions on when to order inventory. A customer who can buy what she wants when she wants. It is a happy customer. Three, inventory management reduces waste when inventory is stored properly, you reduce damage from heat, moisture pests and theft. The result safe quality products reliably available for sale and less wasted on products you can't sell.

Additionally, you must consider your customers needs. Even if a product is high quality, it will not sell if it is not useful to customers to determine your customer's needs. Consider the following questions, how are customers impacted by weather seasons and pest control? Are customers in need of new products or services? What are current market trends and what quality and sustainability standards do your customers require? The answers to these questions should help drive your business's inventory and stocking decisions. Consider the following scenario. Jean Paul owns a retail business that provides inputs and tools to local farmers. He stores his inventory in a small warehouse behind his storefront. One day, Jean Paul sends an employee to the warehouse to restock seed in the storefront. Upon entering the warehouse, the employee discovers several shelves of unlabeled products. He spends several minutes rummaging through the products in search of the seeds. When he finally locates the seeds, he notices several small punctures in the bags alarmed. He reports the problem to Jean Paul. Jean Paul thanks the employee for his attentiveness and examines the problem for himself. He discovers that the holes have been created by insects that have now infested the seeds and compromised their quality. He is no longer able to sell the products.",

He orders seeds and fertilizer from suppliers, then stocks them in his warehouse before selling them to his customers. These actions repeat regularly in the same order. We call it a business cycle. A cycle has a clear beginning and a clear end for retailers. There are three business cycles. First, the inventory cycle is about product. It begins when you receive new inventory from a supplier. It ends when you sell that inventory. Second, the financial cycle is about payment. It begins when you pay a supplier for inventory, it ends when a customer pays you for that inventory. And third, the operating cycle combines the inventory cycle and financial cycle. It begins when you receive inventory from a supplier. It ends when a customer pays you for that inventory. So how do business cycles impact retailers? Let's return to Miguel to find out when his suppliers deliver seeds and fertilizer to his shop. Miguel pays them immediately. Meanwhile, Miguel offers credit to his customers. They buy seeds and fertilizer from his shop yet. Do not have to pay for 30 days. Miguel's financial cycle is too long. Consequently, he does not have enough cash to pay other expenses such as rent and salaries. What can Miguel do to avoid the situation? He should find ways to shorten his financial cycle. There are several strategies he can try. First, he can negotiate with suppliers to receive inventory on credit, not paying them immediately delays the start of the financial cycle. Of course, not all suppliers will agree to this but he can try. Some might agree. Others might offer something else such as a discount for immediate payment. Second, Miguel can eliminate customer credit. That is he can require payment as soon as customers receive inventory. Of course, some customers will not like this arrangement and might leave his business. That is a trade off. Third. Miguel can offer an incentive to customers for prepayment. Some customers will gladly pay before receiving a product if it means they pay a lower price. Miguel can then use their prepayment to finance inventory. He receives from suppliers. In the end, Miguel negotiates with his suppliers who agree to extend him 10 days credit. He offers customers a 15% discount for prepayment and a 5% discount. If they pay when they receive the product, he decides to keep the 30 day credit for those customers who value late payment more than a discount is his situation perfect. No, but it has improved. Miguel now has enough cash on hand to run and grow his business. He can continue to work with suppliers and customers to further improve his business cycles. Good job, Miguel.

                "text": "3. What are best- and worst-case business cycles (2.21):\n\nAs we learn from Miguel's scenario, a best case business cycle would include a short financial cycle. It's even possible to eliminate the financial cycle altogether. This occurs when a business receives a down payment from a customer for products. The business uses the customer's cash instead of its own to cover costs for inventory and operations. It maintains an accounts payable balance due to the customer until the customer takes delivery of the products. In addition, if the business receives credit from its supplier for inventory, it will not have to pay for that purchase until sometime in the future. So while the receipt of inventory triggers the inventory cycle, it does not trigger the financial cycle. Once the customer takes delivery of the products purchased with a down payment, the inventory cycle ends and the accounts payable due to the customer is cleared. Finally, the business pays its supplier clearing the account's payable balance generated by the earlier receipt of inventory. With this, the operating cycle ends as well. In this scenario, the business never needs to recover its investment in inventory because it does not make the payment to its supplier until after it receives payment from customers. However, it is unusual for a customer to make a 100% down payment without receiving a benefit such as a small price discount while providing a customer discount may reduce the business's profit margin. It may be worth the benefit of eliminating the financial cycle. On the other hand, a worst case business cycle would be made up of a long financial cycle. One that lasts the entire length of the operating cycle. A long financial cycle can occur when a business makes a down payment for inventory tying up funds in inventory that it has not yet received and which it cannot sell. If the business also offers credit to its customers, it will not receive payment when it delivers products but will instead maintain an accounts receivable or credit balance with its customers. This means the financial cycle will continue beyond the inventory cycle until the customers pay their credit balances. The business will be forced to find alternative sources of cash to pay its bills. If the business ends up taking a short term loan to cover costs, it will also need to pay interest.",

Businesses can adopt two strategies. First, businesses should balance the quantity of inventory kept on hand with customer demand for products availability from suppliers and seasonal production. Effective management of this balance will improve profitability. Second, businesses should aim to reduce the costs associated with inventory. Many businesses manage inventory by loading up on products in anticipation of periods of high demand and and then holding on to or discarding extra product that cannot be sold. This tactic can be costly when the cost of ordering storage and shrinkage are totaled. How can you optimize the inventory within your business to become as efficient as possible? Credit within the business cycle also includes several other related costs for the business. The cost of ordering is measured in terms of the time it takes for a business to prepare an order, inspect, receipt of goods, put away items, verify the invoice and process payment. The cost of storing can be calculated by identifying the total cost of capital or cash invested in inventory, utilities and storage facility rental and the cost of shrinkage is determined by monitoring the total value of products that cannot be sold due to expiration damage or theft. Businesses can optimize their inventory cycles by reducing time spent on ordering, improving storage efficiency and minimizing product loss.",

Businesses that classify and track inventory regularly are better able to manage their inventory and financial cycles. There are numerous methods for inventory management. One of the best known is the ABC method which is named for the three categories of inventory. It uses A B and C. The ABC method classifies products based on how valuable they are to your business. It is based on the idea that most of your revenues come from only a few critical products. You calculate the value of each product you sell and then classify the product as category A category B or category C category A includes products that are essential to your business. Survival items. In category A are your biggest money makers. They are the most valuable products you stock. There should only be a few products in this category without them, you would not stay in business category. B includes products that are important but not essential like category A products, they are in the middle in terms of value to your business. Over time, some products in this category could become essential and move into category A others might slip into category C. Category C includes the least valuable products. They help generate income for your business, but individually do not contribute much. The ABC method of inventory management helps you focus on the product that matters. Most. Use ABC analysis to make decisions about which product to stock, how much to stock we had to cut costs and other operational issues.

                "text": "2. Example of the ABC method of inventory management (2.59):\n\nLet's look at an example of how to use the ABC method for inventory management. Marco's Agro input store sells a range of products, much of the inventory gets mixed together because space in the warehouse is not separated by product type. This means that product is often lost. Marco would like to use the ABC method to better manage his inventory. So he decides to review his annual sales. This table describes the unit sales price and annual sales volumes for products sold by Marco's Agro input shop. Marco's first step is to calculate the total number of units sold in his business to do this. He adds up all the units and arrives at a figure of 770. In the second step, Marco calculates the percentage of total annual units sold per product to do this. He divides the units for each product by total units sold for all products. For example, the percentage of total annual units sold for fertilizer is 180 divided by 770. The same formula can be applied to the remaining four products and calculate the percentage of total annual units sold per product in this case, we see that the largest percentage corresponds to pesticide indicating the importance of this product to Marco's business. His next step is to perform a similar set of calculations to determine each product's percentage of sales. He must first calculate each product's sales by multiplying unit price by annual units sold. For example, the total annual sales for fertilizer is 500 times 180 which gives a total of 90,000. These are the total annual sales for each product. Again, we see that pesticide is his largest selling product. Next, Marco calculates each product's percentage of total sales by dividing the product's annual sales by total sales. For example, the percent of total annual sales for fertilizer is 90,000 divided by 456,000 which equals 19.7%. The same formula can be applied to the remaining four products to calculate the percentage of total annual sales per product. All percentages should total up to 100%. In this case, these are the percentages for each product based on these outcomes. Marco can now assign one item to category A one item to category B and the remaining items to category C. He recalls that category A is made up of items essential to the business' survival. Typically there are very few items. In this category, category B is made up of items that are important to the business but not quite as important as those in category A and category c includes all other items in the business that are not critical.4. How do you count inventory (3.06):\n\nAnother aspect of inventory management is counting, counting inventory ensures that your businesses physical counts match your records and allows you to reconcile differences where necessary. You should count inventory as often as possible. But at least once a month, if applicable, your business may also choose to perform a weight check. Your business should perform item counts and or weight checks at all points of receipt and dispatch doing so will help your business identify an account for shrinkage address. The causes of shrinkage determine minimum levels and reorder points and check product expiration and reception dates. You may wish to count all inventory at one time on a designated day each month. Alternatively, you may use a system known as cycle counting. This system allows you to count small amounts of inventory each day to do this break. Counts into manageable chunks such as two or three products each day, count products in your storage facility and on store shelves perform counts when you aren't busy and make sure all your products are accounted for by comparing your physical counts to the counts in your ledgers or computer system. After a few weeks, you will have counted all of your inventory. The next step is to reconcile differences between your physical counts and the counts in your ledgers or computer. Ideally, you will have no differences between your inventory records and your physical inventory counts. But if you do, you need to figure out why first recount an inventory item to ensure that the difference was not the result of human error. Next look for missing page work. For example, if an order came into inventory from a supplier or left inventory for a delivery to a customer, it's possible that the transaction was not logged at the time of the count and finally accept the variance and log the difference. If the physical count is lower than the quantity in your records, input the missing units into the spoilage loss column in the item's product control card and deduct the shrinkage from the balance. Note these losses as they will be important, not only for accounting purposes but also for addressing theft. If the physical count is higher than the quantity in your books, input the additional units in the quantity in field of the item's product card and add it to the balance. After noting the differences, you need to reconcile them by ensuring that the inventory balance is equal to the number you have physically counted. This is the number that will be used to determine the timing of your next round of purchase orders. A best practice is to use computer systems to track inventory which makes the calculation of balances and shrinkage easy to execute. There are many options in the market for computer or phone based inventory applications and some are available to download for a free trial period. These applications allow you to update and track your inventory as well as alert you when stock is low and remind you of key order dates.",

You should count inventory as often as possible. But at least once a month, if applicable, your business may also choose to perform a weight check. Your business should perform item counts and or weight checks at all points of receipt and dispatch doing so will help your business identify an account for shrinkage address. The causes of shrinkage determine minimum levels and reorder points and check product expiration and reception dates. You may wish to count all inventory at one time on a designated day each month. Alternatively, you may use a system known as cycle counting. This system allows you to count small amounts of inventory each day to do this break. Counts into manageable chunks such as two or three products each day, count products in your storage facility and on store shelves perform counts when you aren't busy and make sure all your products are accounted for by comparing your physical counts to the counts in your ledgers or computer system. After a few weeks, you will have counted all of your inventory. The next step is to reconcile differences between your physical counts and the counts in your ledgers or computer. Ideally, you will have no differences between your inventory records and your physical inventory counts. But if you do, you need to figure out why first recount an inventory item to ensure that the difference was not the result of human error. Next look for missing page work. For example, if an order came into inventory from a supplier or left inventory for a delivery to a customer, it's possible that the transaction was not logged at the time of the count and finally accept the variance and log the difference. If the physical count is lower than the quantity in your records, input the missing units into the spoilage loss column in the item's product control card and deduct the shrinkage from the balance. Note these losses as they will be important, not only for accounting purposes but also for addressing theft. If the physical count is higher than the quantity in your books, input the additional units in the quantity in field of the item's product card and add it to the balance. After noting the differences, you need to reconcile them by ensuring that the inventory balance is equal to the number you have physically counted. This is the number that will be used to determine the timing of your next round of purchase orders. A best practice is to use computer systems to track inventory which makes the calculation of balances and shrinkage easy to execute. There are many options in the market for computer or phone based inventory applications and some are available to download for a free trial period. These applications allow you to update and track your inventory as well as alert you when stock is low and remind you of key order dates.",

He is one of 12 farmers in the region that needs seeds for the upcoming planting season. Mamadu finds three local businesses that offer seed. These three businesses each want to bring the maximum number of customers into their shop. In other words, they are competing for customers. The competition provides Mamadu and other farmers with different choices for buying seeds. Customers prioritize which features are most important to them from price to range of selection to quality of service and then select a retailer accordingly. The businesses that Mamadu and the other farmers choose to purchase from will generate sales income from customer purchases of seed. In turn that sales income will allow the businesses to invest in their own growth and development.

By tracking these metrics, you can better identify potential customer satisfaction problems and take prompt actions. For example, a business tracks its daily transactions for two weeks based on the graph which of the following statements about the business relationship to customers are accurate. All of these statements are true. Transactions rise during the weekend and fall midweek to maximize customer satisfaction. The business should ensure that a store is adequately stocked by Friday morning and appropriately staffed during weekends. The business might consider offering me with deals to increase sales when indicators suggest customer care is a problem. Consider which of the three pillars of customer satisfaction need improvement and establish an action plan to address them. For example, if sales or transactions decline, it might indicate low product quality. If there are more customers complaints, it might indicate poor staff skills. If customers complain about time accessibility or inefficiency, it might indicate a convenience problem.",

We wanna be able to understand poor customer satisfaction issues and we want to learn how to address customer complaints. When we consider customer satisfaction first, we must understand the three pillars or principles of customer satisfaction. The first pillar deals with product factors. This includes a range of the range of products offered as well as their quality. The second pillar focuses on human factors. This includes the shop owner or the shop assistant, skills and knowledge, their attitudes and behaviors, their ability to get things right and their treatment of the customer as an individual. The third pillar deals with the convenience factors such as the location of your shop delivery schedules. If you offer delivery and payment arrangements, convenience factors may be more important to some buyers and users than others. Other buyers may be most interested in quality. Um It just each customer is different. So to maximize customer satisfaction, this must be managed by the shop owner to ensure customer loyalty, maxim, maximization of customer satisfaction may be thought of as a formula that consists of the following components which add up to excellence, commitment to customer satisfaction from the owner and anyone who works in the shop, the ability of the retail shop owners and assistants to have the skills needed to perform their roles. Standards that are established set of rules or guidelines. They cover product quality, um behavior of the shop owner or assistance when dealing with customers and any other measurable item. The retail shop owner wishes to define communication between managers, supervisors and shop assistants. This will reduce misunderstandings errors and customer dissatisfaction, attention to detail. This means that as a retail shop owner, you make an effort to understand the customer's needs and to truly focus in on the best solution. Excellence is the result of this. If this formula is followed, excellence and customer satisfaction can translate into years of customer loyalty. So remember, a customer does business with you year after year, that's, you know, you're retaining that customer because they're satisfied with, with the business they're doing with, with your retail shop. So what are the ABC S of customer service, their attitude behavior and competence. Customer service employees play an important role in maintaining customer care standards. These employees are often the company's first contact with customers. These employees should use the ABC S for customer service ABC S stand for attitude, behavior and competence. Let's explore what each letter stands for attitude, a business influences its employees work attitude, their attitude will greatly influence how they behave towards customers. Employees with good attitudes are often more competent, their jobs. A good attitude includes enjoying helping people handling people well, providing fair equal treatment to all and understanding people with special needs. As the owner of the shop, you can demonstrate this good attitude when working with customers behavior. This includes greeting customers, establishing a rapport with customers and learning how one can help. And competent, competent employees have the skills and the attributes to do their jobs. Well, they set goals and identify and analyze and solve problems. So let's talk about implementing customer care within your shop. So you wanna measure customer satisfaction using key performance indicators. You wanna look for the causes of poor customer service and then you wanna correct those causes. Every business should consider how it approaches customer satisfaction organizations that measure customer satisfaction parameters regularly because satisfaction may change over time, use key performance indicators that will help you engaging. Whether customers are satisfied, satisfied. For example, if customers are satisfied, then sales should rise remain constant. Customers should come back time after time, maybe even buy more from your shop. Measuring customer satisfaction accurately helps businesses quickly deal with problems that could negatively impact customer service. Customer satisfaction can be measured by surveying customers or interviewing a customer focus group, pay attention to customer complaints and address them as they as quickly as possible. Once you identify areas of weakness, you can start correcting the cause. Let's talk about addressing the causes of customer poor customer satisfaction. Customers may be unsatisfied because of the quality of the products or services. The skills of the shop and the ease and the efficiencies of shopping. Two common causes of low customer satisfaction are inferior products and poor shop, assistant skills, customer service or focus group. As we discussed on the previous slide could reveal that customers are not satisfied because of the low quality of available products or products aren't available when they need them. This would give you an opportunity to speak with customers to determine which products they would like to purchase. Shop. Assistants do not have sufficient product knowledge to deal with customer questions. This is another common reason for customer dissatisfaction. As long as the customer's needs are not met, there is a chance of losing them by stocking the right products and ensuring the shop assistance have the necessary selling and technical skills. You will minimize mistakes and generate repeat business. So let's talk about how you deal with customer complaints. When a customer is unhappy, you should listen, you should be sympathetic and you should concentrate on. So solutions, you should not offer excuses, you should not argue with them and you should not try to placate customers anger. We know that many customer complaints are fair while some are questionable. Either way you must show the customer that you are willing to listen and look for a solution to their problem. Never put the blame for the problem on the customer. For example, let's say you sell candy and a customer bought a piece of chocolate and was deeply unhappy with, with the the quality of the chocolate. Um and your shop assistant um refused the customer's request and told her that she got what she paid for. What do you think would happen? What went wrong here, blaming customers is not a professional way of caring for the customer. It leaves the customer with a poor impression of the shop. With permission from the shop owner, the shop assistant could have replaced the item with a new one. Even if the business suffered a small loss, this would have left the customer satisfied and potentially generated future business instead of possibly losing a customer when confronted with situations like this, keep the lifetime value of the customer in mind. Also keep in mind that customers talk to other people. If you treat a customer poorly in your shop, they are likely to tell their neighbors and to tell other people which may impact whether they're willing to use your shop or not. The role of retail shop owners. If you own the shop, what's your role in customer satisfaction? You need to establish a customer oriented culture in your shop. You need to set standards for customer satisfaction and customer engagement and you need to build a total quality system for your shop. Customer service in a shop begins with the retail shop owner with the shop owner commitment. Most businesses will struggle to satisfy customers. The shop owner establishes a customer oriented culture. The shop owner sets standards for customer satisfaction. The shop owner ensures the quality of goods and services. More importantly, many employees are not motivated to provide good customer service or be concerned with customer service if the shop owner is not concerned with it. And as I noted earlier, you can demonstrate good customer service and a focus on customer satisfaction to anyone who's working in your shop. Thank you.",

Let's say you manage a small retail shop that sells fertilizer. You rent warehouse space at a cost of $500 per month. One month, you sell only 10 bags of fertilizer compared to your usual 100 bags. How much do you owe in rent? The answer is $500. Your rent does not change because you had a bad sales month costs can be classified as fixed variable or mixed depending on how they change in response to changes in business activity. Often sales volume classifying costs helps you anticipate their behavior and set profitable prices. Let's consider the three main types of costs. Fixed costs are constant. They do not change based on changes in business activity. As we saw rent is a fixed cost. The advantage of fixed costs is that they are easy to budget for because they are predictable. However, they are also difficult to adjust if you need to cut costs. Variable costs fluctuate with business activity, they often increase during busy periods. For example, fuel costs may be higher in your busy season and lower in your off season. The advantage of variable costs is that you have some control over them. You may be able to reduce variable costs through bulk purchasing or waste reduction. The drawback of variable costs is that they are difficult to budget for since they fluctuate, mixed costs are a combination of fixed and variable costs. For instance, you pay employees a monthly salary, but during the busy season, you also pay for overtime work. The salary is fixed but the overtime pay is variable. Therefore, employee pay is a mixed cost. When you can explain cost behavior, you are on your way to understanding the profitability of your business. Classifying costs correctly allows you to set a profitable price and calculate how much you will have to sell to make a profit. Continue this course to learn more about classifying costs.",

Proper cost management can turn an unprofitable business into a profitable one. Do you know how much these costs are in your business today? Understanding business profitability is critical. What does it mean to be profitable? Profit is what remains after all expenses? Are deducted from revenue. Profits are different from cash flow in a business. Cash flow is the flow of money in and out of the business. But cash that comes into the business is not necessarily a profit. It might be owed to creditors. For example, a company that provides supplies to the business on credit or to owners of borrowed capital. But keep in mind that a business can be profitable but have no cash. For example, you might have sold products to a customer who takes two months to pay you. Your creditors want their money right away. Therefore, you owe them money but your customers have not paid you. So this business may be profitable yet have no working capital to sustain the business. Take a moment to think about your business.

Some of these costs can be controlled while others cannot. Business owners can help organize and better understand their costs by identifying them as controllable or uncontrollable. Controllable costs can be reduced through efficient operations. For example, a business owner can control costs of stock and inventory management, direct labor and sales commissions, marketing and overhead costs such as the use of electricity and staff salaries for non direct labor. A business can reduce these costs through efficient operations. Uncontrollable costs cannot be directly controlled. These costs include insurance, advertising costs required by a distributor and certain taxes and fees. A business can lessen the impact of these costs by budgeting for them.

How to reduce controllable costs 2.45:\n\nOnce you have identified your controllable costs, you can group them into logical categories and analyze each one to determine if they can be reduced. Overhead refers to operational costs that are not linked to sales. There are a number of areas where you may be able to control operational and over head costs. For example, can you reduce your consumption of electricity? Are your rent costs too high for the location? Can you pay down loans with cash to reduce interest payments? Are your marketing materials effective? Are you over paying for phone plans or do you pay too much for insurance material costs? Deal with inventory management. Ask, are you carrying too much inventory? If so? Can you sell some inventory before replenishing stocks? Do you have old or obsolete inventory taking up space in your storage area? Are you getting the best terms from your suppliers? Are your customers paying on time? And are your products properly priced staff costs? Focus on your employee expenses to reduce these expenses? Ask how many employees do you have on salary? Are you paying a lot of overtime? If so, is it for tasks that are justifiable such as time? Sensitive matters or can you reduce employee hours or hire people seasonally without affecting your productivity? So how do you prioritize which costs to work to control? It may seem overwhelming to look at all these costs and try to pick a starting point. But here are two suggestions on how to prioritize. One method is to list the easiest costs to reduce in each category. For example, in the case of overhead, if your insurance policy is coming up for renewal, contact the insurance business and ask about options to reduce the cost, also contact other companies to get competitive quotes. Do some of your customers have email or social media? Could you reduce your marketing costs by using the internet? Other costs would move to the bottom of this list. For example, rent could be a difficult cost to reduce if you have a long term contract or you don't want to incur moving costs. A second method is to list all controllable costs in all categories from greatest to least. For example, if you determine staff salaries and utilities are your two highest controllable costs. A 10% reduction in these costs alone could have as much of an impact as reducing multiple smaller costs. This doesn't mean you can't go back and look at the smaller costs later. But by focusing on the largest costs first, you can achieve larger cost reductions.",

If they are not clear or you do not explain why they are being implemented, then employees will not be able to follow them. Managers cannot be expected to enforce them and you will not be able to achieve your objective owners. And management should lead by example and establish a business culture.

As a retailer, you likely know that costs affect the profitability of your business as your costs go up, your profitability goes down to make a profit. You must set a price for a product that is higher than your costs and you must consider all costs. That is your sales price must exceed the cost price. Sales price is the amount you charge customers cost price is the total cost of obtaining and selling. That product cost price includes how much you pay your supplier for the product expenses related to carrying the product such as rent and utilities, expenses related to selling the product such as delivery discount and advertising. Any additional costs. Sales price must be higher than cost price for you to make a profit. Let's consider an example. Ebo owns a retail business that sells pesticides to farmers. He purchases pesticides from his supplier for 95 francs per liter. He sells pesticides to farmers for 100 francs per liter. Does Abbot make a profit? At first glance, it might appear that he makes five francs per liter as profit 100 francs minus 95 Francs is five Francs. However, Ebo has only considered one cost the price he pays his supplier. What about delivery costs? Which Ebo covers for customers? What about the wages of his two employees? What about warehouse rental? All these costs must be considered when setting a sales price?

And that's really the the importance of understanding and having an accurate understanding of your profitability. So cost analysis will help you determine whether your business is profitable. Um that also can help you understand the profitability of your business. So, you know, cost analysis, we're talking about things like, you know, doing various calculations such as cost per unit profit per unit sold, um your cost price, your break even. So it's, it's really starting to understand um essentially the efficiency of your business. How much money are you making or losing on each unit that you, that you sell in your business. Um And understanding that is really is it, it's really critical because you can, you can without understanding that you can look at your profits and think I'm a pretty profitable business, but you may not be a very efficient business. And so by improving, by managing your costs, controlling your costs, you could increase your profit on the same amount of sales because you'd be have lower cost per item that you're selling and you know, once you understand that once you understand your, your costs and how to, how to calculate various ratios to, to, to study your costs. Um you can really start to um better understand your business, better understand what are the best investments to be making in your business? Is it expansion, is it um hiring more staff and trying to get more sales out of your current location? Um And so it's, it, it really is, I think quite critical and, and, and so one thing I want to say is, you know, there is a difference between profitability and profit. Profit is an absolute number. It is your revenues minus your costs. That's your profit for that period of time. Whereas profitability is a measure of the efficiency of your business. You know, how much is it costing you to get the sales in your business? So for an example, we have two businesses, they both have the same profit, their profit is 10,000 at one business. Their revenues are 100,000, the other business, the big business, their revenues are a million. This smaller business has greater profitability because it's getting 10,000 in profit from 100,000 in sales. Whereas the million, the the business that has a million in revenue is is also getting the same 10,000 in profit. And so their cost to get that 10,000 is much higher. Um you want to be the 100,000 that's getting 10,000. That's, that's what you want to be. You want to be the, you know, the, you want your cost of sales to be as, as low as possible you can or as controlled as possible. So it's really crucial to have that understanding, to think about your business in terms of efficiency, in terms of what it's costing you to get your sales. And so I encourage you to pay to take the rest of this course and learn more about that.",

What is the difference between profit and profitability 1.04:\n\nProfit is an absolute number and is calculated by adding up the revenues and subtracting the expenses for a specific period of time. Profit is the financial gain the business realizes during this period, profitability is relative to the size of the business and is the most common measure of business efficiency. Measuring profitability will help you to decide if you should cut costs or grow sales volume. For example, should you work to grow your business in your existing location or consider a second location or a larger facility? Let's look at an example. In this case, business A and Business B each had 10,000 francs in profit. Last month, business A earned 10,000 francs profit on revenue of 100,000 francs and Business B earned 10,000 francs on revenue of 1 million francs while each business earned the same profit.

Growth should make your business more efficient, resulting in increased profitability and cost savings. The growth of a business should not result in an increase in expenses that uses all the earnings from increased sales. An efficient business should experience the following benefits as it expands, sales should increase cost per unit sold should fall and profitability per unit should rise. Your increased profitability and cost savings will be reflected in the per unit profit calculations. Businesses should take the following steps to ensure its scale to profitability, keep accurate financial records. This allows the business to know its expenses and profits, analyze your financial records. Track how much of your sales are being cost to costs, study the pluses and minuses of every expansion opportunity. Don't be afraid to take risks but don't take unnecessary ones. Can you name a risk your business should take to grow. Can you name a risk? It shouldn't take increase customers and members monitor your business's marketing budget. Make sure new customers or members are acquired at a minimal cost and make sure the business is operating at optimum efficiency. Make every effort to cut costs, make sure the impact of those cuts does not reduce operating efficiency. Why does scaling to profitability matter? A small business will be limited in its capacity to provide additional service to its customers or members? For example, the customers of a small business may have to carry their product home while a larger business can purchase a truck for deliveries. When a business grows efficiently and becomes more profitable, it can provide better service and more educational operational and financial services to customers, staff or members.",

This could mean moving to a larger location or adding a second location in this topic. You will look at some of the issues to consider. When expanding your business, you should assess if you are currently meeting your performance goals such as sales per month, profit sales per retail, square meter, cash reserves and cost per unit calculations. If so, you may be ready for expanding to a larger location or opening a second location. If not, you may want to improve existing performance before taking on a larger or additional shop. If your cash flow isn't healthy, you may make your cash flow problem worse by adding a larger or additional space. Make sure you have access to enough cash to run your current operations at full capacity and to support your new operations for 3 to 6 months. Assess if it is better for you to invest time resources and cash into expansion or to focus on growing your business in your existing location. Do you have family support to expand the business? Will you continue to provide for them at the same? Level if you expand or will there be a period with less cash for your family while you are investing in the business expansion? If so, what will your family need to give up to support the expansion? Do you use a system for recordkeeping, cash management, bookkeeping, and personnel management to support an expanded business? It is very difficult to put these systems into place after you've expanded, deciding to try expanding your business is a critical decision for any business person. But why should a business consider expanding and what are the benefits of expansion? In many cases? An expanded business gives you greater resilience to market downturns since scaling to profitability results in lower costs per unit. A larger business has a greater market presence, greater buying or bargaining power and is in a more competitive position in the market and the larger business is usually able to attract good customers and employees. So how can a business expand? In most cases, the business can expand by taking moves to increase its ability to receive and store more product such as expanding the size of its warehouse, the business can improve its ability to serve customers by purchasing new equipment such as a delivery truck or upgrading current equipment. And the business can work to attract new customers by expanding its sales and marketing activities. But before enacting any expansion plans, a business must determine if expansion is financially feasible. An ill timed or poorly planned expansion could doom the business.",

Last month, he bought a new pickup truck to deliver products to farmers, but now he doesn't have money to cover the rent. This can happen to any business, even those that turn a healthy profit.

What is a cash budget? While the cash flow statement is a summary of cash entering and leaving your business over a period of time in the past, a cash budget is a forecast of how much cash you expect to come into and go out of your business in the future. A cash budget is an estimate of the cash flows over a defined period of time. A cash budget allows you to plan your future purchases, operating expenses and investments. If your business wants to invest in a new pickup truck. You will use a cash budget to show how much the truck costs, whether the business has sufficient cash to pay for it. And if not, how long it will take to save for the purchase and whether a loan is needed or not, a cash budget enables you to predict when cash shortfalls are likely to occur. So you can take action to avoid them. For example, you may need a short term loan to cover expenses at a point in the year. When you risk a shortfall, when you prepare for cash shortfalls, you can pay suppliers on time. This makes them more likely to offer better payment terms in the future. You can also use a cash budget to help prevent business interruptions. It can also help you decide when to invest idle cash reserves in short term notes or even stocks to increase your business's income stable cash flow makes a business attractive to lenders.

Recommend that you create a separate bank account specifically for your reserve fund. Then you should try to deposit a fixed amount of your revenues into your cash reserve account each month. Try to invest 5 to 10% of your revenues to its cash reserves each month. The cash reserve account should be interest bearing this way. If you absolutely must use some of your cash reserves, you can use the interest and not deduct from the balance. So the cash reserve stays intact. However, you should resist the urge to tap into the reserve fund unless absolutely necessary. If you make a withdrawal from your cash reserve, pay it back as soon as possible. And remember as your enterprise grows, your cash reserve needs to grow too. Remember, a cash reserve is an emergency fund for your business. Cash reserves can help prepare your business for unanticipated costs and can help it to take on new growth opportunities.

I am a co-operative specialist with the Agribusiness Leadership Program, which is part of the International Finance Corporation. I'd like to talk to you today about cash reserves. When you think about your family and an emergency happens, perhaps something happens to the roof of your house or a family member gets sick. Where do you get the cash to, to resolve these issues? It will cost money. This is, it's very important in my country. We say can we save for a rainy day? Well, the rainy day is a financial emergency. This in a small business is extremely important in a small business. We call it a cash reserve. A cash reserve is something you hope you don't have to use but you have it in the event of a financial emergency. Think of it this way, what would happen if a customer forgot or was late in paying an invoice? What would that do to your cash flow? What happens if a key employee gets really sick and you need to help them or hire somebody to take their place for a short period of time? What happens if a major piece of equipment breaks down or you have to buy a new one. All these things cost money. This is where a cash reserve is so important. It helps protect your small business to make sure that you have enough cash in the event of a financial emergency. It's also very important to think of the cash reserve as something very positive that you have. It may help you as collateral to get a loan or perhaps as a cash match to obtain some other financing. So it's very, very important and most small businesses will quickly admit that they don't plan well for this type of an emergency. And even when they do plan, you can't predict when something may happen that could knock you over financially. I would highly recommend that as a small business owner, you consider how to plan for and maintain a cash reserve for your small business. It is recommended that you have between three and six months of operating capital saved in your cash reserve. Now, I encourage you to continue with the course on cash reserves. I hope you enjoy it.

And in this first session, we're talking about procuring produce the better life farming. Retailers are expected to play a role in product aggregation as a better life farming alliance is supposed to include off takers, large buyers for tomatoes and watermelon in Tanzania. Better life farming has not added the off taker yet. Nevertheless, this module is included because we fully expect to add an off taker partner in Tanzania in anticipation of that partnership, this module will cover how retailers will collect and aggregate produce from farmers in their communities to be sold to the large off taker better life farming. Retailers will also provide production advice and sell inputs to farmers. The goal is to have 500 farmers selling to each better life farming retail business. So the objectives of this module are to identify strategies for an efficient procurement process as an aggregator to detail how to collect and deliver product at the right time and with the right quantity and quality to explain key elements of contracts. At the end of this model, we will review this slide to ensure that we have succeeded in meeting these objectives. So the first session is procuring produce in this session, we will talk about procurement of tomatoes and watermelon from farmers. So the objectives of this session are to define what is procurement, to define procurement practices that will allow your business to better serve its farmers and to describe why it's important to ensure the quality of produce, your business aggregates and sells. So let's start what is procuring produce, procuring produce is the process of obtaining produce from farmers and selling it to buyers. Simple as that you will be the intermediary between the farmers and the buyers. And procurement in your business often involves obtaining the necessary quantities of produce the necessary quality of products and gathering those at the right time. And for the best price you know to be successful, this will include quality control and inventory management. The procurement process requires that you obtain the necessary quantities of quality products and services at the right time. And for the best price, a business must understand the needs of its farmers and buyers. Procurement should be planned with this in mind. Once you procure, the product procurement also covers quality control and inventory management. Procurement plays a critical role in your business. This session will help you identify opportunities to enhance or develop your procurement practices to better serve your farmers and buyers. If your business can represent and meet the needs of your buyers, then your business is a ver very valuable partner for farmers. Why is this? It is economical and efficient for large off taker to work with one organization, your business and reach as many farmers rather than to for the buyer to try to do business with each individual farmer. So in terms of procurement terms, the typical procurement terms include the price, uh any premium payments that might or bonuses that might be included the payment terms. When will you get paid? When will you be able to pay your farmers transportation? Who's responsible for transporting the product? And is there any non-compete or exclusivity requirements in the in the agreement? So when you, you know when we talked about contracts, you remember what were some of the items you can expect to see in a contract, you can expect to see the roles and responsibility of each partner. Uh dispute resolution, price determination, the start and ending date for the contract notification requirements that either party wants to exit the contract. An important component of any contract is negotiating the terms that will be the most value to your farmers. Some typical terms are price, the amount will be paid for the produce or how will the price be determined? Premium payments or bonuses? Will there be a premium payment or a rebate for quality or quantity supplied? What are the payment terms will be cash upon pickup and, and deliver the product or credit if credit, how many days and what is the cost of credit transportation? Will buyers collect the produce from your business? If so? What are the specifics of this arrangement not compete? Do your buyers want you to commit to only selling produce to them? How does this benefit the buyer? How does it benefit your business? What other terms might be important to you? What are the goals in produce, procurement, improved prices for farmers access to market price information for farmers negotiating for farmers for best prices or services, aggregating products to obtain improved pricing with the ability to handle store and manage inventory and to reduce defects or waste. Through focus a focus on quality. Your goals and procurement will shift as the priorities of your businesses and your farmers change. Here are a few goals to keep in mind when you develop your procurement practices, you wanna reduce expenses um through organizing transportation and storage, you want to be able to improve, you want to be able to achieve this through negotiating for farmers for better pricing and perhaps additional services such as transport. Um You wanna reduce the the facts waste or improve the quality of the final product to to obtain highest prices and you want to help your customers avoid traveling long distances and other issues. Um that plague the procurement process. Let's talk about quality assurance. Quality assurance refers to the procedures for informing farmers of quality requirements and for checking, produce quality stringent and regular quality checks. Of produce will benefit your fa buyers and farmers and your business. It is your business's responsibility to ensure that there are procedures in place for checking the quality of produce you buy and sell. You must apply these procedures stringently and regularly. You must inform farmers of the quality requirements. Produce does not meet that that does not meet quality specifications can negatively impact the functioning of your business. You may want to have procedures or plans in place for certain issues that may occur. For instance, what if a farmer delivers less than you ordered? Remember our conflict resolution role play in the leadership module. What would your business do in this situation? It is important for your farmers to understand what will happen. What might you do if a farmer does not deliver enough product, potential answers, you could try to find the product elsewhere or sell what you have to the off taker in a planned manner. Thank you.",

Describe how your business will ensure that the product it collects is in the proper quantity and describe how your business will ensure the product it collects is in the proper quality. What your buyers Expecta the buyer expectations of your business in respect of product aggregation from your customers are on time. Deliveries, reliable quantity and quality and a fair price. Maintaining a good relationship with your buyers. Depends on you being a reliable retailer. That means the produce must be on time with the proper quantity and first rate quality. The aggregation operations consist of three stage stages, pre collection, the things you do before you start to collect the product, the collection itself and the delivery of products to buyer. The goal of every retail shop owner should be to ensure that the product you collect is on time and in the proper quantity with first rate quality. What will your business do in all three stages to achieve this goal, we will reflect on the collection process as we go through this session. How can you improve the timeliness and the quantity and the quality of product? One, there's five steps. The first step is to make a plan with the farmers. The second is to create an annual plan. The third is to monitor the growing season. The fourth is to address product loss in storage and five is to prepare farmers for collection day. Once your business has implemented a collection process, there are specific actions you can take during the collection stage that will help you achieve three goals of timeliness, quantity and quality. First, let's consider timeliness and quantity. How can you ensure that the proper quantities from farmers at the right time? Being able to reliably estimate quantities expected from farmers for the season is key to running a successful business. The five ways you can do this are to plan with the farmers create an annual production plan, monitor the growing season, address side selling and product loss in storage and to help farmers prepare for collection day. So what does this mean in more detail? So the plan of farmers hold a farmer meeting to inform them of the businesses plan to aggregate market products on their behalf, be explicit about what is expected of farmers and how they will benefit. Create an annual production plan. A production plan is a forecast of how much product each farmer will deliver to the business. This will ensure your business can supply buyers as promised. It will also help your business manage logistics, especially collection day planning and coordinations as well as storage capabilities in the warehouse. If you have one and then you need to monitor the growing season, conduct field visits to determine whether farmers are on track to deliver the expected quantities on time. This helps maintain good communication between the business and its farmers and it improves the projections of expected quantities of farmer product for the season. This is important for the relationship with the customers as they also need to forecast their production levels. It can signal potential problems with site selling. If monitoring does not indicate a poor growing season, then then lower than expected quantity delivered to the business can mean product is going elsewhere. And it also gives you an opportunity to let the suppliers know if the quantities or the quality is not going to be what is expected. Good communication with the suppliers is critically important. Address product loss and storage. There are four main causes of product, lo loss and storage, excessive heat, moisture, pests and theft. You it's best to have producers deliver product as quickly as possible so that you can help manage these risks of of quality loss and product loss. Prepare farmers for collection days. Farmers should put products in clean bags with no holes. Do not overfill bags. Always separate products of different qualities and ensure that the product is adequately dried or field sorted.",

They also provide a, provide a way to resolve problems when they occur. One of the most important contracts in your business will have is with an off taker or a buyer of its products contract negotiations. Some contract terms are negotiable. Negotiation is the process of arriving at an agreement. It usually means giving something up in exchange for something you want more. An example is you negotiate that the buyer will collect product, but you accept a lower price in return. Remembers negotiation is the process of arriving at an agreement. It usually means giving up something in exchange for something you want more. The key term here is in exchange negotiation is always about compromise. You must decide what parts of the contract you really want and what part to compromise on. For example, if you want the buyer to collect the product from your warehouse. So you do not bear the transport responsibility. You might have to settle on a lower price to get it. Generally, you will get a higher price if you deliver the product to the buyer. One of the most important parts of a contract on an off taker is pricing. How do you determine the market price for the product? Ask a trusted market expert extension agent or field agronomy agents about the market price, seek pricing information from other trusted sources such as trade newsletters, government offices, reliable internet sites and reliable radio programs.",

For example, if a borrower agrees to a loan of 100,000 at a fixed rate of 10% for 1.5 years, when you calculate the total of 18 monthly payments with interest on the loan added to each month, this results in payments of 6005.71 a month to fully amortize this loan. The total amount paid over the term of the loan is equal to the loan amount plus the total interest paid over the life of the loan. Since the loan amount is 100,000 and the total interest over the life of the loan is 8102.73. The total cost of the loan is 108,102 0.73 lenders should provide borrowers with an amortization table that lists each payment due date. The principal payment for each period, the interest payment for each period and the remaining loan balance. After each payment, the interest payment will be higher when a borrower first starts paying down a loan because the loan balance is at its highest value. With each payment, the amount of payment that goes to pay interest decreases while the amount paying down the remaining loan principal increases. This is because while each monthly payment is the same, the balance of the loan is declining with each payment, which means that the amount owed in interest is also decreasing. As long as a borrower makes payments on time. According to this schedule, he or she will not incur any additional fees or interest charges. Late payments will likely result in the lender charging a penalty and possibly some additional interest non payment of the loan will result in the loan considered to be in default which can incur the penalties that were spelled out within the loan agreement. In this example, the borrower will pay a total of 8102.73 in interest. The loan will be paid off after all of the payments were made or earlier. If the borrower pays more than the required monthly payments, loan payments for a business impacts both the business income statement and the balance sheet principal payments reduce a loan balance, which is a liability. The principal portion of the loan is reflected in the balance sheet. Interest payments are an expense. So the interest portion of the loan payment is reflected in the income statement. Credit does not come without a price. There are risks to taking on credit. You can borrow more than you can afford to repay. If you don't make payments on time, you could damage your reputation as well as your chances to obtain credit in the future. If you pay late, you will probably have to pay late fees. And if you have these types of problems paying your loan, you might have to pay a high interest rate on future loans.",

These will help her business operate more efficiently and earn more revenue. She asks her accountant to determine how much money she would need to move forward with these plans. Her accountant informs her she does not have enough cash available to implement her plans. She must obtain credit. What is credit? Credit describes an agreement that a borrower makes with a lender to obtain funds in the present and repay the lender in the future. Credit can be used to finance many aspects of the business, including purchases of new equipment, funding of new business opportunities, payment of unanticipated expenses, operational expenses and inventory. When a borrower repays a lender, they must also pay interest interest is a lender's charge to a borrower for using credit. It is usually expressed as a percentage interest can be fixed or variable fixed interest stays the same for the life of a loan. Variable interest can change during the life of a loan depending on the state of the credit market. Variable interest rates may rise or decline. Who can provide credit to Ceta. There are many sources of credit including commercial banks, saving and credit co-operatives, microfinance institutions, development, banks, buyers and suppliers. Sitar may buy fertilizer or seeds on credit. That means the suppliers give her a loan and she will repay them when she sells the products. Some buyers provide financing to farmers or businesses through advance payments and supply of inputs. If SITA is a member of a Saving and Credit co-operative, she may seek funding from the organization. There are organizations that provide loans to small businesses. Sita can look for these organizations in her area. There are also development banks that are run by a country's government or a group of allied countries for the purpose of economic development. Sit a can look for funding there. Finally, Ceta may go to a commercial bank that lends money to people and businesses. Let's move to the next lesson to learn about what types of credits are available.\n\nWhat types of credit are available:\n\nWhat types of credits are available? Credit is available in various forms including secured and unsecured credit from a lender. A line of credit from a supplier, working capital credit from a buyer. Advances on future sales and leasing. Each type of credit has a different use in a business. A secured loan requires collateral as security in case your business fails to repay. Secured loans are usually repaid in monthly installments over a specific period of time. The main difference between secured and unsecured loans is collateral and secured loans do not require collateral which represents a greater risk to the lender. Therefore, interest rates on unsecured loans will be higher than those unsecured loans. A line of credit sets a maximum amount of funds available for your business. Over a period of time, you can draw down the funds whenever the need arises. Usually to cover cash shortfall. Once funds are drawn, repayment must be made within the time limit. This type of fund usually requires collateral. Working capital credit can help your business cover day to day operating expenses such as payroll rent and inventory. This helps the business keep operating even when experiencing cash flow fluctuations working capital credit might take the form of a line of credit, cash advance and or another type of credit lenders may or may not require collateral an advance means the buyer pays before receiving product advance payments are a form of working capital credit. They also protect your business against the risk of non payment. Instead of taking a loan to buy an asset, a business can consider leasing it. Leasing means you rent but do not own the asset for a specified period of time. Under specific conditions, rent is often paid on a monthly basis. Well done. Next, you will practice making decisions about credit.",

The tractor will help him operate his business more efficiently and save labor costs. Mamadou has enough cash on hand to cover his farm's operations for six months as well as a savings account that will cover 20% of the cost of the tractor. Since the tractor is a large investment, he decides to apply for a loan at his local bank. Before meeting with bank officials, Mamadu considers what documentation he will need for his application and what questions the banker may ask to show the bank. He is a good candidate for a loan. Mamadou must complete a loan application and prepare a loan proposal. There are four steps in the process of applying for a loan. First. The borrower must prepare and submit a loan application together with the documentation required by the lender. The lender then reviews the submitted documentation to confirm its accuracy and determines whether the loan is an acceptable risk. This is referred to as conducting due diligence and underwriting. If the loan is approved, the lender will provide the borrower with a loan letter containing a set of terms. Otherwise, the lender will inform the borrower that the loan request was denied. Finally, the lender and the borrower close the loan. This means the borrower reviews and accepts the terms of the approved loan. The borrower and the lender sign the loan agreement and the lender distributes the funds to the borrower during the loan process. Remember to think of your lender as a partner, not as a bad guy. When a lender lend their money, they are lending their own capital to you in good faith and they trust that you'll repay the loan with interest. That is how lenders make money lenders want to do more business with good partners. If your business performs well on the initial loan, the lender might be interested in doing more business with you in the future. Transparency is key to gaining trust in any business relationship, including a relationship with a lender to ensure transparency, all the documents in a loan proposal as well as any of your discussions with a lender must be truthful. A good start to gaining a lender's trust is by having audited financial statements and documented controls such as cash controls and accounting procedures in place. This shows the lender that you are making a serious effort to maintain accurate ledgers and forecasts. Well done. Next, you will explore the documentation required for a loan application",

The terms will likely require certain information to be submitted to the lender including financial statements, notification of significant changes to business plans or performance and notification of the sale or destruction of assets used for collateral, different types of loans and lenders will have different requirements and the terms terms of your loan may also specify reporting of additional items. For example, a loan used for funding a business project may require that you submit a report on the status of the project. It is important for the borrower to stay current on their loan reporting requirements. This will help the borrower to build trust with the lender and increase the chances for future business. In addition to reporting, you will need to maintain a loan ledger to track your payments of principal and interest as well as your loan balance. The loan ledger should include the date the payment was made. The value of the principal payment, the value of the interest payment and the ending balance of the loan after the payment is recorded. Remember that accurate accounting depends on accurate record keeping. You should file your payment receipts in a receipt book in case of an audit or a dispute with the lender about whether a payment was made. And when unfortunately for the lender and the borrower, not all loans follow a consistent trail of payments until the end. For example, if a borrower gets behind on payments, the lender will send a late payment notification. If the borrower does not respond, the loan is classified as delinquent when a borrower falls behind on payments. The lender charges a fee as specified in the loan agreement. A default occurs after a borrower misses payments repeatedly, usually after 3 to 6 periods of non-payment. At this point, the lender will send a notice of default to the borrower. If a borrower defaults, the borrower will likely lose the collateral, they used to secure the loan. They may also face legal action. Additionally, their reputation will be damaged and it will be more difficult to obtain a loan in the future. But keep in mind that lenders do not want you to default. Lenders are in the business of making money by lending money and charging interest, not losing money.",

Sita provides credit to many other customers like Amari offering credit helps build trust and customer loyalty resulting in increased sales. A customer is more likely to buy from a business that offers credit for both credit loans and cash loans. The business and the customer should sign an agreement that details the terms of the loan.

When monitoring outstanding loans, businesses should communicate with borrowers regularly encourage borrowers to inform the business if loan repayment is challenged or impossible work with borrowers who have trouble making payments and consider restructuring the loan. If appropriate. For example, a business can adjust the terms of a loan if it decides the borrower needs assistance and is still a good risk. A loan default occurs when a borrower fails to pay back a debt. According to the initial agreement, the specifics of the default process will vary amongst businesses but procedures for collecting a debt should generally include a first notification for a late payment. If the borrower continues to miss payment, they are typically sent a second notifying them of the delinquent loan payment. At that point, it is useful to contact the borrower to learn why the borrower is having difficulty repaying the loan on time and trying to work out a solution to help the borrower repay. This can be done through a phone call or site visit to discuss the repayment of the delinquent loans. Your credit policy should establish the number of days of an overdue payment that will trigger each of these actions, be sure to establish a process that best supports your business and maintains a good relationship with your customers.

Let's say your strengths are as follows. You have committed farmers selling over 80% of produce to the business. You have contracts with three buyers and you have a knowledgeable and trusted staff. How could you capitalize on these strengths? You could use farmer engagement skills to recruit new farmers to supply products. You could also work with buyers to explore or negotiate additional contract terms that support growth in terms of weaknesses. Your warehouse is old and the roof has several leaks leading to lower product quality. Your paper based bookkeeping system is unable to keep up with business growth needed management reports come too late for decision making. How could you address these weaknesses? Perhaps you could seek out loans for replacing the warehouse roof and purchasing a computerized accounting system that includes product tracing software. Now, let's consider your opportunities. Two buyers want more product from you. Plus farmers from three neighboring villages have asked to market their production to you. How could you seize these opportunities? Maybe you could enroll new farmers who will commit to selling at least 75% of their product to your business. You could also ask potential new buyers for purchase terms and compare those with terms of existing buyers. The threats your business faces are independent buyers offering higher prices to your growers and shifting rainfall patterns due to climate change. How could you mitigate these threats? Perhaps you could pay quality premiums to growers which are not offered by independent buyers. You could work with local microfinance institutions to introduce drip irrigation to farmers. Let's consider an example. A general manager of a business that sells farming supplies to local farmers has recently completed a sort analysis for the business. Here are the results strengths, good relationships with customers community and farmers provides quality goods and equipment weaknesses and reliable delivery service and poor communication with fertilizer distributor opportunities.

Once smart objectives have been set, you will need to determine the action you will take to achieve each objective. For example, if one of your objectives is to sell a certain amount of fertilizer, you could increase your marketing efforts in that area. Next, decide on progress indicators. Progress indicators are how you will know your smart objectives are being met. A good progress indicator will relate directly to the objective and clearly show how your efforts are moving you closer to achieving it. Each indicator should have a clear outcome. For example, if your smart objective is to increase cells by 25% in the next year, you need to know total cells for the most recent year and then track future sales figures. Calculating the increase in cells. Smart objectives should have a clear timeline for completion. Next set a review schedule and determine who should be involved in the monitoring. This is a set time to check in on the progress your business is making towards meeting its objectives. Finally use what you have learned to continuously improve. Let's look at an example of how MS Cooper has increased. Baley cells by 20% in a year. I am the General Manager of the Stronger Together co-operative. We analyzed the amount of bali collected from members last year and realized that we were only collecting about 50% of the Bali our members grow each year. We set an objective to increase our collection by 20% and to focus on getting more value from existing members. We added two field agents to visit our members. We also discuss production challenges and remind farmers about how they benefit from the co-operative. We also worked with our primary buyer to obtain production credit so we can pay farmers upon delivery of Bali during the first two weeks of harvest. Our collection rates are already 40% higher than last year. At this time, you have completed this course on objective setting. If you would like to apply these key concepts to your own business, try these next steps for each objective, decide on actions to take, to achieve it, decide on progress indicators for each objective, establish a review schedule and lastly use what you learn to continuously improve.

For instance, aflotoxin poisoning has recently afflicted Baley crops. People have gotten sick and even died from aflatoxin poisoning. In response, the government introduced a new standard for acceptable levels of aflatoxin in crops. It is also sending more inspectors to businesses to test for Aflotoxin. Another risk is the leaking roof on our warehouse. This will expose our inventory to weather damage and rodents and even increase the aflatoxin risk as improper storage can contribute to contamination. She realizes that these are risks she needs to assess and plan for to minimize the impact on our business. Mrs Chola cannot control stricter standards and testing for Aflotoxin, however, she can mitigate this risk by educating farmers and investing in more quality control for Bali crops. She decides to organize workshops for Bali farmers and hire a quality control tester.

When setting a price in this topic, you will examine what pricing is and what it is not a definition of pricing is the amount you're asking customers to pay for your product or service. When establishing a price consider the following, you must determine what customers are willing to pay. You must also account for your costs, credit period discounts and competitor pricing. When pricing your goods and services, the goal is to set a price that is accepted by the market and will achieve your company's business targets and brand image goals lower prices can lead to higher sales volumes but lower margins. Sometimes a lower price signals, lower quality but not always. Higher prices can lead to lower sales volumes but higher margins. Sometimes a higher price signals higher quality but not always. How do you determine the prices you set for your products? Now that we know what pricing is, we should also define what pricing is not. Pricing is not about always offering the lowest price. Instead, pricing is about convincing the customer of the advantage of shopping at your business. This includes offering better value. Than the competition such as reduced time and distance, better customer service and customer credit. We have come to the end of this topic now that you know what pricing is? Let's look at the next topic to consider different pricing strategies.",

                "text": "\n\n2. How do you set a price (935):\n\nFour pricing strategies. There are four common pricing strategies. They are one bundling, two cost plus pricing, three competitive pricing and lastly four penetration pricing. Let us look at each in depth. Let's begin with. Bling bundling is a pricing strategy that combines a product and the service into a single unit for a discounted price that is less than the sum of the individual prices. For example, a farmer who lives far from your input shop does not have a vehicle to transport the seeds he purchased back to his farm. You may offer a bundled price for the seeds and delivery. This can be the difference between making the sale and having the customer find another retailer who offers delivery. The advantage of bundling is that it can move idle inventory. The disadvantage of bundling is that it risks unnecessary discounts. In the last example, the farmer might have been willing to pay full price for the seeds and full price for delivery on tattoo cost plus pricing cost plus pricing is a strategy where a business sets a selling price of a product by adding a mark up to the production or acquisition cost. The makeup is a percentage or fixed amount. Let's consider an example of cost plus pricing in the context of an agro input retailer. Suppose an agro input retailer sells a particular brand of fertilizer to determine the price using cost plus pricing. The retailer would calculate the cost of acquiring the fertilizer from the supplier which includes factors like the purchase price, transportation costs and any other associated expenses. For instance, let's assume the retailer acquired a batch of fertilizer for $50 per bag and incurred an additional $5 per bag for transportation and handling costs. The retailer's total cost per bag would be $55. Now, let's say the retailer wants to apply a 20% markup on the cost to cover its desired profit margin to calculate the selling price using cost plus pricing. The retailer would add the Maca percentage to the cost. Mac up is equals to cost multiplied by Mac up percentage. Mac up is equals to $55 multiplied by 0.20 which is equals to $11. Therefore, the selling price would be selling price is equals to cost plus markup. Selling price is equals to $55 plus $11 which equals to $66. The advantage of cost plus pricing is that it is simple to calculate the disadvantage of cost plus pricing is that it ignores customers willingness to pay and competitors pricing. Let's move to three competitive pricing. Competitive pricing is a strategy where the business sets its price based on prices charged by competitors or the prevailing market rates. Consider an example of competitive pricing for a co-operative selling cocoa. The cooperative's goal is to maintain profitability while setting market competitive prices for its cocoa beans. The co operative would fast gather information about the current prices for cocoa beans on the market, taking into account factors like quality variety and where they came from. Additionally, they would analyze the pricing strategies of their competitors which might include larger cocoa suppliers, local farmers or other co-operatives. Let's say the co-operative discovers that $2000 per metric ton is the market rate for cocoa beans of comparable quality and origin to stay competitive. They could choose to value their cocoa bins somewhat below this market rate. Let's say they choose to offer a 5% discount on the market rate to determine the selling price. Using competitive pricing. The co-operative would apply the discount to the market rate. Discount is equals to market rate multiplied by discount percentage. Therefore, discount is equals to $2000 multiplied by 0.05 which is equals to $100. The selling price would be selling price is equals to market rate minus discount. Therefore, the selling price would be $2000 minus $100 which equals to $1900 per metric ton by pricing their cocoa beans at $1900 per metric ton. The co-operative aims to position themselves as a competitive option in the market. It is important for the co-operative to consider its cost structure including production costs, labor expenses, processing costs, and other overhead costs to ensure the selling price allows for profitability. It is worth noting that competitive pricing may vary based on market conditions, changes in demand and supply and other factors. The advantage of competitive pricing is that it is relatively low risk. The disadvantage of competitive pricing is that it ignores customer willingness to pay a higher price. Let's move to the last one. Penetration pricing. Penetration pricing is a strategy in which a business sets the price of a product disruptively low in order to quickly gain market share penetrate the market by attracting customers from its competitors. Consider an Agro input shop that begins selling a new line of organic fertilizers. The business aims to attract customers and quickly gain market share by setting a price below the market rate. Assume the current market price for organic fertilizers of comparable quality is $50 per bag. The Agro input shop decides to set an initial price that is much lower than the market rate. This is penetration pricing. They decide to price the organic fertilizer at $40 per bag which represents a 20% discount compared to the market rate by pricing the bag at $40. The Agro input shop hopes to attract price sensitive customers and persuade them to switch from competitors the advantage of penetration pricing is that it can quickly build market share. The disadvantage of penetration pricing is that it attracts customers who are not loyal. Once prices increase, we've come to the end of this topic. Now that you know about four pricing strategies. Let's look at the next topic to consider whether it is a good idea to increase price or decrease price.",

The stacks become more likely to collapse. And the bags are designed to hold a specific weight. So, if they are overfilled, the risk of breaking is high.\n\nAlways separate products of different qualities.\nIf a farmer delivers bags containing product of mixed quality (for example, certified and non-certified cocoa) the mixed product must be downgraded to the lower quality. So, it is to the farmers' advantage to clearly separate bags of different quality. And if the end customer finds out that the quality is mixed, this can erode trust and the customer might refuse to buy from your cooperative again. It is important to ensure farmers know how to separate different grades of product.",

Below are tips to stay organized. \n\nCategorize your expenses\nOrganize your expenses by category. After receiving a receipt, determine which expense category it belongs to. Then, keep receipts for different categories separate.  \nFor example, place utilities receipts in one pile and office supplies receipts in another.\n\nFile receipts\nUse folders and a filing system to keep receipts safe and accessible. Include the types of receipts on the label of the folder. For example, you may dedicate a folder to vehicle-related receipts. \nConsider organizing the folders in your storage in alphabetical order so they are easy to find.\n\nOrganize receipts chronologically\nWhen placing your receipts in folders, place each receipt in chronological order. Keep the most recent receipts in the front of the folder and older receipts in the back.  \nPutting receipts in chronological order is beneficial when you need to look for a specific receipt.\n\nOrganize receipts immediately\nOrganize receipts as soon as you receive them. It takes the stress out of doing them all at once and keeps you as organized as possible. \nIf you do not organize receipts right away, try to organize a few at a time instead of waiting a month or longer. Organizing a few receipts each day will make it feel like less of a task.",

Remember to include these cash outflows in your forecast.\n\nWhen forecasting future cash outflows, remember that the date you make a payment is not always the same as the date you incur the actual cost. You may pay some costs in advance and some afterward. \n\nDepending on the needs of your business, you can decide how far in advance to forecast your cash flow. A cash budget might cover one month, six months, one year, or some other time period. ",

Develop strong relationships that make your suppliers view you as a reliable borrower.\n\nIf you find a bank that looks promising, do more business with that bank to build trust. For example, open a business account with that bank.\n\nStep 3\nFind a guarantor\nAs an alternative to collateral, you may find an individual who is willing to be a guarantor. A guarantor will guarantee loan payments if you are unable to pay. This could be a family member, business partner, or someone else.\n\nStep 4\nNegotiate loan terms\nTry to negotiate the loan terms with the lender.

Below are tips to stay organized. \n\nCategorize your expenses\nOrganize your expenses by category. After receiving a receipt, determine which expense category it belongs to. Then, keep receipts for different categories separate.  \nFor example, place utilities receipts in one pile and office supplies receipts in another.\n\nFile receipts\nUse folders and a filing system to keep receipts safe and accessible. Include the types of receipts on the label of the folder. For example, you may dedicate a folder to vehicle-related receipts. \nConsider organizing the folders in your storage in alphabetical order so they are easy to find.\n\nOrganize receipts chronologically\nWhen placing your receipts in folders, place each receipt in chronological order. Keep the most recent receipts in the front of the folder and older receipts in the back.  \nPutting receipts in chronological order is beneficial when you need to look for a specific receipt.\n\nOrganize receipts immediately\nOrganize receipts as soon as you receive them. It takes the stress out of doing them all at once and keeps you as organized as possible. \nIf you do not organize receipts right away, try to organize a few at a time instead of waiting a month or longer. Organizing a few receipts each day will make it feel like less of a task.",
